0x0. Introduction
-----------------

This is a native client for streamate webcam websites. It works for all such
websites implementing the naiad systems API.

It contains:
 - RTMP client
 - NetStream / NetConnection media control interfaces
 - AMF, and basic AMF3 parsers
 - A fair chunk of the Naiad flex application protocol
 - Python interfaces to much of the above

There are:
 - Python scripts for scraping details with and without login
 - wmdump: C application to dump a webcam stream to FLV
 - wmclient: A GTK interface to streamate sites

Compared to the flash web based client it allows you to:
 - record streams directly from the wire with no re-encoding
 - copy and paste from chat
 - watch more than one stream simultaneously
 - more?

0x1. Compilation from Source
----------------------------

The following command ought to do it:

 $ ./configure && make


0x2. TODO list
--------------

IDL language for generating C code/structs to wrap
arbitrary flex protcols? Would be pretty neat!

Support all message types:
 - Handle gold show status changes
 - Support pledge gold, go pvt
 - Decode HTML entities, smilies in chat

AMF parsing:
 - Sometimes we get shit like CR or NUL in strings (eg. roomtopic)
 - Will we need more complete AMF3 parsing in practice? doesn't look like it
 - Nicer way to handle NaiadCheckup calls?

wmclient:
 - Tiled, video-only, mode

Windows port:
 - just requires os-win32.c implementing winsock stuff

OSX port:
 - Cocoa/QTKit gui, best approach?

Timestamp generation and bandwidth management:
 - Use real timestamps in rtmp code, where necessary

Server and/or proxy?
