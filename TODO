Windows port:
 - just requires os-win32.c implementing winsock stuff
 - we'll need sock_init()/sock_fini() API with refcounts (and use them) for
   initialising/cleaning up winsock subsystem

NetStatus cleanups:
 - this module should just handle netstatus object and do all the
   marshalling/demarshalling between C/AMF messages related to that object
 - remove state field as part of the API
 - provide callback blocks for:
   - object creation/destruction
   - NetConnection.*
   - NetStream.Play.*
 - should make mayhem.c a lot tider

Timestamp generation and bandwidth management:
 - Use real timestamps in rtmp code, where necessary

Handle gold show status changes

Test with legit account details on paid show

Proper userlist management

Decode HTML entities in chat

AMF parsing:
 - Sometimes we get shit like CR or NUL in strings (eg. roomtopic)
 - Will we need more complete AMF3 parsing in practice? doesn't look like it
 - Nicer way to handle NaiadCheckup calls?
