Support all message types:
 - Handle gold show status changes
 - Support pledge gold, go pvt
 - Decode HTML entities, smilies in chat

AMF parsing:
 - Sometimes we get shit like CR or NUL in strings (eg. roomtopic)
 - Will we need more complete AMF3 parsing in practice? doesn't look like it
 - Nicer way to handle NaiadCheckup calls?

wmclient:
 - Tiled video-only mode

Windows port:
 - just requires os-win32.c implementing winsock stuff

OSX port:
 - Cocoa/QTKit gui, best approach?

Timestamp generation and bandwidth management:
 - Use real timestamps in rtmp code, where necessary

Server and/or proxy?

IDL language for generating C code/structs to wrap
arbitrary flex protcols? Would be pretty neat
