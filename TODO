Windows port:
 - just requires os-win32.c implementing winsock stuff
 - we'll need sock_init()/sock_fini() API with refcounts (and use them) for
   initialising/cleaning up winsock subsystem

Timestamp generation and bandwidth management:
 - Use real timestamps in rtmp code, where necessary

Support all message types:
 - Handle gold show status changes
 - Proper userlist management
 - Decode HTML entities, smilies in chat

Support legit account details on paid show
 - Need to scrape new vars, possibly handle logins/cookies
 - Support send chat, pledge gold, go pvt

Non-blocking I/O framework
 - Use nbio library?
 - Will want glib io event poller backend
 - Will want win32 completion port backend
 - Change top-level API to support both blocking and non-blocking models
 - Add server and/or proxy?

AMF parsing:
 - Sometimes we get shit like CR or NUL in strings (eg. roomtopic)
 - Will we need more complete AMF3 parsing in practice? doesn't look like it
 - Nicer way to handle NaiadCheckup calls?
