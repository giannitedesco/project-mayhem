Windows port:
 - just requires os-win32.c implementing winsock stuff
 - we'll need sock_init()/sock_fini() API with refcounts (and use them) for
   initialising/cleaning up winsock subsystem

NetStatus cleanups:
 - this module should just handle netstatus object and do all the
   marshalling/demarshalling between C/AMF messages related to that object
 - remove state field as part of the API
 - provide callback blocks for:
   - object creation/destruction
   - NetConnection.*
   - NetStream.Play.*
 - should make mayhem.c a lot tider

AMF parsing:
 - Sometimes we get shit like CR or NUL in strings (eg. roomtopic)
 - NaiadUserList messages don't parse
 - Will we need more complete AMF3 parsing in practice? doesn't look like it

Timestamp generation and bandwidth management:
 - Use real timestamps in rtmp code, where necessary
 - Something funky going on with our buffer management? Or why do we keep
   getting timeout messages when things appear to be going fine?

Flesh out stubbed out handlers:
 - mostly naiad* in mayhem.c
